Hi Everyone!

This is my first blog post. Just want to quickly introduce myself.

<!--more-->

I'm a passionate programmer (C#, PHP, Java, Python) who is currently completing my undergrad (Computer Science) at the 
University of Toronto. I've always wanted to contribute back to the development community and I figured the best way to 
do so is to blog about my adventures as a coder. I'm also an introspective deep thinker and this will be the first time 
I'll be publishing these introspections online to share and connect with other like-minded individuals.

Check back soon for more posts!

And now, here is a hello world C# application as well :).

```csharp
using System;

namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```
